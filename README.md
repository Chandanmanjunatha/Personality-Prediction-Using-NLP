# Personality Prediction Using NLP

## Overview

**Personality Prediction Using NLP** is a Python-based project designed to enhance recommendation systems by incorporating users' personality traits derived from textual data. By utilizing advanced techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and user embeddings, this project aims to offer personalized recommendations that align with both explicit user preferences and implicit personality traits, ultimately improving user satisfaction and engagement.

### Key Features

- **User Embeddings**: Leverages user embeddings to capture intricate patterns of user preferences and behaviors.
- **NLP for Personality Analysis**: Utilizes state-of-the-art NLP techniques to extract personality traits from textual data like reviews and social media posts.
- **Hybrid Recommendation System**: Combines content-based and collaborative filtering with personality-aware features to generate accurate recommendations.
- **Feedback Incorporation**: Continuously improves recommendation algorithms based on user feedback.
- **Scalable and Efficient**: Designed to handle large datasets and provide real-time recommendations with minimal latency.

## Introduction

In todayâ€™s digital landscape, recommendation systems are pivotal in enhancing user experience by offering personalized content and service recommendations. However, traditional systems often fail to account for the nuanced personalities of users, leading to recommendations that might not resonate well with them. 

This project introduces the **Personality-Driven Recommendation System (PDRS)**, a novel approach that integrates user personality profiles with traditional recommendation algorithms. By using NLP techniques and user embeddings, the PDRS provides a more holistic understanding of user preferences, leading to recommendations that are more aligned with individual personality traits.

## Architecture

The PDRS architecture consists of the following key components:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather user data from various sources including social media, reviews, and user interactions.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess textual data using tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
3. **Personality Profiling**: Use the OCEAN personality model to classify users based on their textual data.
4. **User Embeddings Generation**: Train GloVe embeddings and use autoencoders to generate user embeddings.
5. **NLP-driven Personality Analysis**: Apply NLP techniques for sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, and linguistic pattern extraction.
6. **Integration of Recommendation Algorithms**: Combine user embeddings and personality profiles in recommendation algorithms.
7. **Personalized Recommendation Generation**: Generate recommendations based on user preferences and personality traits.
8. **Evaluation and Validation**: Assess the system using metrics like accuracy, diversity, and user satisfaction.
9. **Incorporating User Feedback**: Continuously refine the system based on user interactions and feedback.
10. **Scalability and Efficiency**: Optimize for handling large datasets and providing real-time recommendations.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/) and its `en_core_web_sm` model
- [GloVe Embeddings](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)
- [Autoencoders](https://keras.io/api/models/autoencoder/)
- [Collaborative Filtering Libraries](https://surprise.readthedocs.io/)

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personality-prediction-using-nlp.git
   cd personality-prediction-using-nlp
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download NLP Models**
   ```bash
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

4. **Prepare Data**
   - Place your dataset in the `data/` directory.
   - Ensure the dataset is formatted according to the guidelines in `data/README.md`.

## Usage

### Running the System

1. **Preprocess Data**
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py --input data/raw_data.csv --output data/processed_data.csv
   ```

2. **Generate User Embeddings**
   ```bash
   python generate_embeddings.py --input data/processed_data.csv --output data/embeddings.pkl
   ```

3. **Train the Model**
   ```bash
   python train.py --embeddings data/embeddings.pkl --output models/recommendation_model.pkl
   ```

4. **Generate Recommendations**
   ```bash
   python recommend.py --model models/recommendation_model.pkl --user_id <user_id>
   ```

### Example Commands

```bash
python recommend.py --model models/recommendation_model.pkl --user_id 123
```

## Evaluation

### Metrics

- **Accuracy**: How well the recommendations match user preferences.
- **Diversity**: Variety of recommendations provided.
- **User Satisfaction**: Measured through user feedback and engagement metrics.

### Validation

- **A/B Testing**: Compare the PDRS against traditional recommendation systems.
- **User Studies**: Conduct surveys and interviews to gather qualitative feedback.

### Example Evaluation Script

```bash
python evaluate.py --model models/recommendation_model.pkl --metrics accuracy diversity
```
